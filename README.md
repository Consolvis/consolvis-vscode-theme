# Consolvis Theme üë®‚ÄçüöÄ

[Install on VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=consolvis.consolvis-vscode-theme)

As fellow voyagers in the dynamic realm of IT, we like tinkering and experimenting with new tools and technologies. This theme results from one such experiment, where we've tried to create a simple, clean, and minimalistic Visual Studio Code theme following our brand colors. üöÄ

We've tested it on TypeScript files, where it works best, but it should also work well with other languages. ü§ûüèΩ

The color scheme of this theme is straightforward. We designed to keep your focus on the content while using color to draw attention to key elements. üé®

It highlights functions and classes in orange or red. Types and interfaces use light yellow tones. Constants are marked green, and variables are light blue. Properties are in teal, strings in white, and ternaries and conditionals are in yellow. Most other elements are greyish to keep your attention on these critical parts of your code.

We plan to update this theme and make it better. Your feedback would be valuable to us. Thanks for your understanding and support! üôèüèΩ
